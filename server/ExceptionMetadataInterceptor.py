         You should call method(request_or_iterator, context) to invoke the
         next handler (either the RPC method implementation, or the
         next interceptor in the list).

         Args:
             method: The next interceptor, or method implementation.
             request_or_iterator: The RPC request, as a protobuf message.
             context: The ServicerContext pass by gRPC to the service.

             method(request_or_iterator, context), which is typically the RPC
             method response, as a protobuf message. The interceptor
